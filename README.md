# Lab11-PersonOfTheYear

My first MVC ASP.NET web application.

## Summary

A web application in C# that, given a starter source data file, allows the user to select two years.  Then, after submitting the form with those two input fields filled in, run a post route that redirects to a results page and renders all of the "Times People of the Year" within that time frame.  This application utilizes MVC to structure and scaffold the directory and how it interacts within itself.  There are three actions total, one to get the home page, one to get the results page, and one that posts from the home page form submission and redirects to the result page's get route.

This application is also deployed on Microsoft Azure, and will be fully functional, coming soon!
